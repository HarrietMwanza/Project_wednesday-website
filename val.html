      <p class="val">
        Its valentines right ?!, The time when love is chosen , Pure red oowsing
        , And this time I want it to be you and I . My darling , You are distant
        , You are far off from me in memory and in body This day , the day of
        love celebration there is a linger. A blur whisper of you , your touch,
        your lips , your physique, you . There is a lingering memory of all the
        tables left unturned There is a lingering memory of all promises made
        The memory is distant but I want to reminisce it . I want to server on
        the memory of your beauty in and out , bear and clothed , hot and cold,
        I want to server on the taste of you, the sweet juices of you. So come 
        alittle closer , I wanna tell you how I feel, I wanna show you what my
        hands can do , my lips , my hips, my body on yours , thrusts of pleasure
        I want it to be us . Come a little closer . Come a little closer so I
        can tell you softly how I feel, Come a little closer so you know I mean
        it for real! Come a little closer so I can tell you what I really think
        of when I stare, When I stare at all of you . This valentine I am
        hopeless in love. Floating aimlessly through galaxies I am plucking the
        stars from the sky to make you a celestial crown . This Valentine’s I am
        holding you tight in my honey velvet dreams, Til the break of dawn. This
        Valentine’s I want to know what it is like to love you and never have to
        loose the morning after .
